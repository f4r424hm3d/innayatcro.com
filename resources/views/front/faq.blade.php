                <div class="accordion-body">Yes, you should. Prenatal testing is a way to check to see if your baby
                  might carry certain genetic abnormalities, such as chromosomal or neural tube defects. Only 3 to 5
                  percent of all pregnancies have a birth defect or genetic condition. However, if you are in the higher
                  risk group that includes women older than 35, those with a history of medical abnormalities in a
                  previous pregnancy, and those who are carriers for specific genetic conditions, it is highly essential
                  to get genetic testing done. Besides, we provide this service at our clinic as well.</div>

                <div class="accordion-body">Heartburn is also common in pregnant women. It happens because the uterus
                  is growing and the production of progesterone is increasing, which results in more relaxed stomach
                  muscles and more acid in the esophagus. Certain tricks can be used to prevent or relieve this
                  unpleasant condition, and most work by reducing the acid flow. A woman can eat smaller and more
                  frequent meals, drink ginger root tea once in a while, take short walks after meals, wear loose
                  clothes, and keep her chest and head elevated while sleeping.</div>
